# robokey
A Kotlin program that controls an Arduino Due, making a "robot" keyboard


NOTE: This code does not yet include testing, as it is the source relating to part 2 of my Blog post. 

Testing this will code in itself will be an interesting story I shall explain later. The reason for this it is 
a very heavy user of coroutines, so many normal testing techniques will not work well in these circumstances.

I have left a single test to ensure the test framework is setup.
