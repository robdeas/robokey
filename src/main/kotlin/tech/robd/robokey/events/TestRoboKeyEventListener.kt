/**
 * Test listener for capturing `RoboKeyEvent` instances in the RoboKey application.
 *
 * `TestRoboKeyEventListener` implements `RoboKeyEventListenerInterface` and is intended for
 * use in testing environments. Operating under the "test" profile, it intercepts all published
 * `RoboKeyEvent` instances, storing them in a thread-safe queue. This setup allows test code
 * to verify whether specific events were received, inspect event data, and clear the event
 * history as needed for isolated tests.
 *
 * There are e2 main reasons this is only enabled in test
 * 1. The Queue would fill up after extended operation.
 * 2. Security, this application is not a keylogger
 *
 * Key Annotations:
 * - `@Profile("test")`: Restricts this listener to the "test" profile, preventing it from
 *   being active in production environments.
 * - `@Component`: Registers this listener as a Spring bean, allowing it to participate in
 *   Springâ€™s event-handling mechanisms.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - `handleRoboKeyEvent(event)`: Adds the event to an internal queue upon receipt.
 * - `hasEvent(eventType, data)`: Checks if an event of the specified type (and optional data) was received.
 * - `reset()`: Clears the received event queue, supporting clean test setups.
 * - `getAllEvents()`: Retrieves a list of all captured events for detailed inspection.
 *
 * @property receivedEvents A thread-safe queue that stores captured events.
